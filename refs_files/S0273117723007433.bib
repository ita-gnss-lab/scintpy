abstract = {Transionospheric radio signals might undergo random modulations of their amplitude and phase caused by scattering on irregular structures in the ionosphere. These scintillation phenomena are highly anisotropic, depend on local geomagnetic field configuaration and on the relative position of the signal receiver and scattering irregularity. We derive analytical expressions of anisotropic amplitude and phase scintillation indices using the model of a thin random phase screen. These results extend the classical derivations of [C. Rino, Radio Sci. 14, 1135 (1979)] to a larger domain of applicability including very slant propagation links of the radio wave signals. The derived generalization is based on the assumption that the ionospheric scattering layer has a spherical symmetry as opposed to the original Rino’s assumption of a plan-parallel ionospheric layer. The derived scintillation indices have the simpler analytical form, determine the regions of enhanced scintillation by taking into account the finite curvature of the Earth and of the ionospheric shell, and are divergence-free for large zenith angles of propagation links. For the illustration we discuss the geometric enhancement of scintillation for communication links via a geostationary beacon satellite over the equator.}
