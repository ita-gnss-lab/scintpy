\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}
The purpose of this report is threefold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To synthesize the key aspects of the TPPSM, which are currently scattered across  multiple journal articles, conference papers and books.
    \item To present preliminary results validating a newly refactored code with improved documentation, readability and organization. This refactored code was developed based on the two publicly available TPPSM implementations provided by the Colorado Boulder group on Github.
    \item To stablish a methodology that could be used to generate relevant scintillation time series using the TPPSM.
\end{itemize}
Section \ref{sec:ps_theory} provides a concise review of the phase screen and wave propagation theory underlying the TPPSM.  Section \ref{sec:irregularity_parameter_estimation} presents a brief literature review on the estimation of irregularity parameters used by the TPPSM, highlighting those relevant for generating scintillation time series.  we assess the validity of the time series generated by the proposed refactored TPPSM by comparing their intensity and phase spectra with the expected theoretical shapes provided by a code developed for analyzing the two-component power-law morphology described in \cite{Carrano2016OverviewOfTwoComponentPowerLaw}. Section \ref{sec:time_series_methodology} proposes a general methodology for generating meaningful scintillation time series for different applications. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusions} summarizes the main findings of this work.
